	<quote author="Claire">It was an excellent class for me as I haven't done any yoga for a great many years. I found it comfortable to do and came away feeling good.</quote>
	<quote author="Paul">A beautiful and peaceful session.</quote>
	<quote author="Julie">I thoroughly enjoyed my yoga with Laura and felt wonderful for 3 days, which was brilliant!</quote>
	<quote author="EE">Simple yoga it is! No difficult poses, but gentle stretches which challenge enough to be effective, and relaxing for the mind and body. Just what is needed for this ancient and creaking body to become supple and relaxed.</quote>
	<quote author="CP">Thank you so much for your lovely gentle yoga sessions. They really helped me get to get back on my feet after a particularly long, drawn out illness, at just the right time for me.</quote>
	<quote author="Caroline">Perfect - just what I need to be more flexible.</quote>
	<quote author="CR">For days I'd had a trapped nerve in my back, and shooting pains down one leg. At the start of the yoga session I couldn't do many of the things that I usually find easy, such as bending at the waist, and hanging my head toward the floor. After an hour with Laura my body had relaxed; I could move freely and was no longer in pain.</quote>
	<quote author="LB">I really enjoy my yoga sessions with Laura and feel as though I am doing something positive for my body and for my mind. It is helping me to become more relaxed and optimistic.</quote>
	<quote author="KT">I suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and this yoga class is perfect for me. The gentle stretches and deep relaxation leave me feeling energised. On the occasions when my energy levels are low I feel comfortable enough in the class to sit down for a few minutes and regain my strength. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a simple yoga class that leaves them feeling relaxed and ready to deal with the rest of their day.</quote>
