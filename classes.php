		<div class="title">One to One Yoga Class</div>
		<p>In my home or garden (weather permitting) or your home.</p>
		<p>Suitable for beginners or anyone wanting a simple, gentle class. Adapted to your own abilities and needs. Gentle stretching, moving every part of your body from the tips of your toes to your facial muscles. Working with the breath, we always end with a peaceful guided relaxation which allows you to fully relax and let go, leaving you feeling very peaceful.</p>

 		<div class="title">Yoga for Fatigue</div>
		<p>An extremely gentle class  that could help with <b><i>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</i></b>, <b><i>M.E.</i></b>, <b><i>Fibromyalgia</i></b>, <b><i>M.S.</i></b>, <b><i>Arthritis</i></b>, <b><i>Stress</i></b> or any other illness that has left you feeling fatigued.</p>
		<p>I have personal experience of chronic fatigue in my family and I am fully aware of how this can impact on your life. Having found how helpful yoga is for this condition, I trained with Fiona Agombar in London to teach Yoga Therapy for M.E., Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Chronic Illness.</p>
		<p>I keep postures very gentle and emphasis concentration on the breath which allows you to fully relax and in turn leads to increased energy.</p>
		<p>I teach very intuitively, we work at your own pace, only doing what you feel you can manage on the day. Most postures are done lying down or sitting in a chair, wherever you feel most comfortable. We finish with a long guided relaxation which allows you to fully relax. You can benefit from this gentle, relaxing class, no matter what your energy levels are like.</p>
		<p>I teach private classes, or one to one sessions in your home. Please phone for a supportive chat or to arrange a free visit.</p>
<!-- 		<div class="title">Face Yoga</div>
		<p>Yoga helps tone and relax the body and your face is no different. With face yoga we start with balancing our body, then really study our face, noting tension and long held habits, and work on retraining our facial muscles. This helps to lift, smooth and improve our skin tone. We use massage and relaxation techniques, and laughter is included!</p>
		<p>Even more importantly, we accept and enjoy what we cannot change, allowing us to relax, and remove tension and stress which can show clearly in our faces.</p> -->
